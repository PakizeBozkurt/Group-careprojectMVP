    <p>Caring Hand Birmingham is located in the heart of Birmingham. It provides friendly and comfortable residential care to elderly people after their retirement. More than 40 residents are currently residing in single en suite rooms.
        At the Caring Hand in Birmingham, residents are treated with the utmost dignity, respect and compassion, and are encouraged to maintain their independence. During their stay, residents are encouraged to actively participate in fun activities like art, crafts, designs, dance,  indoor games or religious activities. 
        Staff at Caring Hand Birmingham are highly trained and dedicated to providing the highest standards of care to elderly residents by establishing solid relationships and making care plans to fulfil their care and day-by-day needs.
        It also gives an opportunity to those health or social care students to work as volunteers under the supervision of trained staff members, during their study period so they can find a place to gain practical knowledge and skills in the care field.
